A high temperature and vomiting sensation can be symptoms of various conditions, ranging from a common viral infection to more serious illnesses. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, you can take some self-care measures:\n\n1. Rest and drink plenty of fluids (water, clear broths, electrolyte drinks) to stay hydrated.\n\n2. Use over-the-counter fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen (following the recommended dosage) to manage your temperature, if needed.\n\n3. Avoid solid foods until the vomiting sensation subsides. Start with small, bland meals such as plain crackers or toast once you feel able to eat.\n\n4. If your symptoms worsen or persist, seek medical attention promptly. It would be a good idea to consult a doctor to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.\n\nRemember, it's best to speak with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your symptoms."
